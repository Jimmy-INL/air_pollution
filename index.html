        <h1 class="introTitle">The Big Picture</h1>
		<h2 class="introGrab">4 million people die annually due to outdoor air pollution</h2>
        <p class="introDetails">We can push back on polluters with better air quality monitoring. The governent 
			often places its sensors away from pollution sources. With the price of sensors falling, community groups 
			and residents are starting to buy their own from companies like PurpleAir.com. So far, most sensors wind 
			up in wealthier neighborhoods that face less pollution. Our tool aims to change this.
	
			<!--Government sensors are intentionally placed
			far away from pollution sources and don't shine light on our most heavily polluted neighborhoods. Low-cost
			air pollution sensors, such as those manufactured by Purple Air, have a chance to change this. Purple Air
			sensor count has increased eight-fold in just three years, but sensors tend to be installed in affluent
			neighborhoods far from polluters, while our	neighbors suffering from the most pollution can least afford
			to install them. We propose a tool for identifying	optimal sensor placement to extract the maximum
			potential out of this sensor explosion.-->
		</p>
		<p class="introDetails">
			FairAir predicts which areas on a map face the most air pollution and recommends the best place 
			to put new sensors.  
		</p>	
		<p class="introDetails">	
			Optimal placement of sensors:
			<ul>
			<li>ensures disadvantaged communities have access to air quality data</li>
			<li>improves air quality models for everyone living in a region</li>
			<li>saves money from being wasted on redundant sensor installations</li>
			</ul>
			<!--With our optimal placement tool, communities can install sensors in areas of greatest need, allowing for more accurate
			pollution estimates throughout a city. We believe that the increase in transparency around air pollution will spur 
			better policy, saving lives and improving the health of our communities. 
			
			We also can save hundreds of thousands of dollars 
			in hardware costs by diverting needless installations in areas already teeming with sensors toward sparser areas where even a few sensors provide much needed information. Finally, we are
			proud that we will disproportionally benefit disadvantaged communities who cannot afford to purchase these sensors
			and whose pollution problems would otherwise remain invisible and forgotten.-->

                    Community advocates can use FairAir to help make a case to donors that their community needs sensors. The tool can also help 
					establish a fair way to place the sensors, focusing them on the areas most likely to be impacted by air pollution.

                    FairAir can help foundations, governments, and others who donate air pollution sensors to identify the communities 
					most in need of air quality monitoring. We base our recommendations on where we predict air pollution to be the worst 
					and distance from other sensors. We can include socioeconomic information.

					Live far from a sensor and can't afford one? FairAir offers a free prediction of the air quality in your neighborhood. Our model 
					uses artificial intelligence and data from air quality sensors and weather stations. No model is perfect, and ours is improved 
					when communities install more PurpleAir sensors and place them optimally.

                    We have spoken with activists, professors, and EPA specialists, and have gone into the trenches on toxic tours and climate marches.
					The vocation of activism resonated with us the most and we decided to help those who fight for our clean air every day.

                <p>
                    After the passage of California law XXX, which provides funding for installation of sensors in underrepresented areas, what activists
					have told us is that they need help placing sensors in the best way possible. They are interested in equity, impact, and coverage, so
					we have created several metrics in our demo and placed the choice in activists' hands.

                <p>
                    There are a variety of virtual sensing solutions on the market. They are able to infer to varying degrees of accuracy pollution levels
					at locations without sensors. This is an important component of the story, but we differentiate ourselves by taking the
					next step and a comprehensive solution, making recommendations for additional sensors based on a virtual sensing system.
