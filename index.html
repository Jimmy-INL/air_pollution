        <p class="introDetails">We can push back on polluters with better air quality monitoring. The governent
			often places its sensors away from pollution sources. With the price of sensors falling, community groups
			and residents are starting to buy their own from companies like PurpleAir.com. So far, most sensors wind
			up in wealthier neighborhoods that face less pollution. Our tool aims to change this.

			quality models for everyone, and saves money from being wasted on redundant sensors.

                    Community advocates can use FairAir to help make a case to donors that their community needs sensors. The tool can also help
					establish a fair way to place the sensors, focusing them on the areas most likely to be impacted by air pollution.

                    FairAir can help foundations, governments, and others who donate air pollution sensors to identify the communities
					most in need of air quality monitoring. We base our recommendations on where we predict air pollution to be the worst
					and distance from other sensors.

					Live far from a sensor and can't afford one? FairAir offers a free prediction of the air quality in your neighborhood using
					pollution, weather, and topographic data. No model is perfect, and ours is improved when more sensors are placed optimally.

        <h1 class="approachTitle">How It Works</h1>
        <p class="modelDetails">
		FairAir uses artificial intelligence techniques to predict the levels of air pollution across a region. The prediction combines hourly air and weather sensor data from PurpleAir.com, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Additionally, our model accounts for static features such as topography and land use.
		</p>
		<p class="modelDetails">
		The model focuses on one specific type of air pollution: particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers in diameter, commonly referred to as PM2.5. Pollution particles this small can move deeply into human lungs. Research has linked PM2.5 exposure to many health problems, including asthma, irregular heartbeat, nonfatal heart attacks, and premature death.
		</p>
		<p class="modelDetails">
		FairAir predicts hourly PM2.5 levels at intervals of 500 meters on a regional grid. Each gridpoint is then scored on two factors: its average predicted PM2.5 level over the past seven days and the number of existing sensors in its vicinity. The user is then shown locations where both sensor coverage is sparse and predicted PM2.5 is high. Adding real-life sensors to such  areas would not only provide real-time air quality readings but also improve the accuracy of our model, which includes actual neighbor PM2.5 values as features.
