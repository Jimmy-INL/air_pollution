    "This is an effort to try creating a simple vectorfield to see if the discontinuities are plausible source locations. Each sensor location in the bounding box becomes a node with four vectors attached, one at each of the cardinal points of the compass. If the wind is blowing to the North, the vector attached to the north side of the node will be shown as pointing away from the node (an emitter) if the pollution is elevated; otherwise the vector will be shown pointing toward the node (a sink). In this scenario, we would expect to see this where P is a source of pollution and N are nodes:  \n",
