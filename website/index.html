        <h1 class="introTitle">Background</h1>
		<h2 class="introGrab">4.2 million people die each year due to outdoor air pollution.</h2>
        <p class="introDetails">
            Government sensors are intentionally placed
			far away from pollution sources and don't shine light on our most heavily polluted neighborhoods. Low-cost
			air pollution sensors, such as those manufactured by Purple Air, have a chance to change this. Purple Air
			sensor count has increased eight-fold in just three years, but sensors tend to be installed in affluent
			neighborhoods far from polluters, while our	neighbors suffering from the most pollution can least afford
			to install them. We propose a tool for identifying	optimal sensor placement to extract the maximum
			potential out of this sensor explosion.
		</p>
		<p class="introDetails">
			With an optimal placement tool, activists can install sensors in areas of greatest need, allowing for more accurate
			pollution estimates throughout a city than through virtual sensing methods alone. We believe that the increase in
			transparency around air pollution will spur better policy, saving lives and improving the health of our communities.
			We can save hundreds of thousands of dollars in hardware costs by diverting needless installations in areas already
			teeming with sensors toward sparser areas where even a few sensors provide much needed information. Finally, we are
			proud that we will disproportionally benefit disadvantaged communities who cannot afford to purchase these sensors
			and whose pollution problems would otherwise remain invisible and forgotten.

                <p>
                    We have spoken with activists, professors, and EPA specialists, and have gone into the trenches on toxic tours and climate marches.
					The vocation of activism resonated with us the most and we decided to help those who fight for our clean air every day.

                <hr />
                <p>
                    After the passage of California law XXX, which provides funding for installation of sensors in underrepresented areas, what activists
					have told us is that they need help placing sensors in the best way possible. They are interested in equity, impact, and coverage, so
					we have created several metrics in our demo and placed the choice in activists' hands.

                <p>
                    There are a variety of virtual sensing solutions on the market. They are able to infer to varying degrees of accuracy pollution levels
					at locations without sensors. This is an important component of the story, but we differentiate ourselves by taking the
					next step and a comprehensive solution, making recommendations for additional sensors based on a virtual sensing system.
